<h1>Project: "RARE BOOKS"</h1>

## 1. Project description
This is a project developed for Hackathon F5 22-24 February 2023.

A marketplace website for rare book vendors and buyers was created. 

On this website, the vendor (specialist/antique/rare/independent book sellers) pays a fee to advertise books that they want to sell. Anyone looking for a specific book that is no longer for sale in mainstream bookshops can search for their book at this website. If they find the book on the website they can contact the vendor directly to purchase it. 

## 2. User stories
